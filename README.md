# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 cases across different regions using Python and key data analysis libraries. It answers important questions about confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries and visualizes the data using graphs. 📈

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Python 🐍**
- **Pandas 📊** (Data Manipulation)
- **Seaborn 🎨** (Data Visualization)
- **Matplotlib 📉** (Graph Plotting)

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### ✅ 1. Show the Number of Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered Cases in Each Region
Extracts and displays the count of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases for every region.

### 🚫 2. Remove All Records Where Confirmed Cases Are Less Than 10
Cleans the dataset by filtering out entries with fewer than 10 confirmed cases.

### 🌍 3. Identify the Region with the Maximum Number of Cases
Finds the region with the highest number of recorded COVID-19 cases.

### ⚰️ 4. Find the Minimum Number of Death Cases
Determines the least number of deaths recorded in the dataset.

### 🇮🇳 5. COVID-19 Cases Reported in India till April 29, 2020
Fetches the total confirmed, death, and recovered cases specifically for India up to the given date.

### 📈 6. Line Graph for Region vs. Confirmed Cases
Plots a line graph to visualize the trend of confirmed cases across different regions.

## 📜 How to Run the Code
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Run the Python script to analyze the data.
3. View the generated plots and summary tables.

## 📌 Output Example
- Summary tables of COVID-19 cases per region.
- Filtered dataset without cases below 10.
- Maximum and minimum cases insights.
- Line graph showing confirmed cases across regions.

🚀 Happy Coding & Stay Safe! 😷
